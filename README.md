# Simplify 3D profiles
3D printer profiles for [Simplify 3D software](http://www.simplify3d.com/).

They are based on Cura basic BCN3D Technologies configurations but they are improved-modified to better fit into Simplify 3D workflow. They might include errors or have parts with improvable behaviors so just let me know or help me to improve them.

Installation
------
**Profiles**: just open Simplify 3D and go to File/Import FFF profile

**Printer models**: depending on your OS the folder might change. As far as I have tested:
    OSX: [your_user]/Library/Application Support/Simplify3D/S3D-Software/
    Windows: not tested
    Linux: not tested
